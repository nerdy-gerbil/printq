# also keeps ADMIN_NAME in step with the environment.
# /uploads is created and handed to the app's uid here, before the app
# starts. The runner serves as uid 1001 and Docker creates a missing
# bind-mount source as root, so a fresh deployment would otherwise come up
# with a store it cannot write to and fail on the first upload. The
# migrator already exists to prepare state at boot, and it runs as root,
# so it is the one place that can. Non-recursive: files the app and the
# storage migration write already belong to 1001, and a recursive chown
# over every model on every boot is work for nothing.

# files — docker-compose.prod.yml, an overlay, .env.docker and deploy-wizard.sh
# — and no source tree at all, which docker-compose.prod.yml is built around:
# it consumes images so the host needs no toolchain. An overlay with
# `build: { context: . }` cannot run there, and the first version of this
# migration had exactly that, which made it unusable on the only machine that
# needs it.
#
# Deleted along with the rest of the migration tooling once nobody plausibly has
# a MinIO data directory left.

# Next, sharp, esbuild and puppeteer-core to copy some files between two
# directories, and put all of them into the published-image Trivy scan.
#
# Measured, because the first guess at these numbers was wrong twice. The full
# tree gave 914 MB; four packages gave 824 MB; dropping the Prisma CLI after
# generate (below) gives 769 MB, which is under the existing migrator's 790 MB.
# Prisma dominates whatever is left. Versions come from the real manifest so
# nothing can drift, and `overrides` come across for the reason the migrator
