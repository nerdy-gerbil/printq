 *
 * 2. Redirect visitors with no session cookie, so they get the sign-in page
 *    instead of a shell that flashes and then bounces.
 *
 * The second is NOT the authorisation boundary. It only checks that a cookie
 * is *present* — validating the session here would put a database round trip
 * in front of every request. The real checks are `requireUser`,
 * `requireAdmin` and `storyScope`, which run inside every page and every
 * server action. A forged cookie gets past this file and no further; there is
 * a probe for exactly that (A01-forge).

   * `admin()` is enabled in src/lib/auth.ts for what it adds to the schema and
   * to sign-in — the `role` and `banned` fields, and the refusal to create a
   * session for a suspended account. It also mounts a dozen endpoints this app
   * does not use: every admin screen goes through Prisma directly
   * (`db.user.findMany` for the member list, `db.user.update` for suspension),
   * and `authClient.admin` is never called from the browser.
   *
   * Measured before closing them, rather than assumed, because the assumption
   * was wrong. With an admin session most of this surface already refused:
   * set-user-password, remove-user, ban-user, update-user, list-user-sessions
   * and revoke-user-sessions all answered 403 from the plugin's own access
   * control, and create-user answered 403 from this app's invite hook. Two did
   * not:
   *
   *   impersonate-user   200, with a session token for another account. Not
   *                      theoretical — the probe that called it had its own
   *                      browser become that user, and the next check found
   *                      /admin/invites rendering an error page because the
   *                      caller was no longer an admin. This is the primitive
   *                      that recovery deliberately stopped using; the audit
   *                      doc says "access.reissued … is gone", and it was not.
   *   list-users         200, with every account's name, e-mail and verified
   *                      flag. A roster, to anyone holding an admin cookie.
   *
   * And set-role answered 500, which is an unhandled path rather than a refusal.
   *
   * The 403s are the reason to close the whole prefix rather than those two.
   * They come from Better Auth's default permission statements — not from
   * anything this app asserts — so they can widen on a version bump without a
   * line of this repository changing. Nothing here writes to the audit trail
   * either, and every path is listed at /api/openapi.json for any signed-in
   * client to read.
   *
   * It matters because src/lib/reauth.ts exists on the reasoning that four
   * actions outlive a session, so each asks for the password or passkey again
   * when the sign-in is over five minutes old — "the thief has the session, not
   * the passkey". A copied admin cookie could reach impersonation inside its
   * twenty idle minutes without ever meeting that bar.
   *
   * The whole prefix rather than a list of names, so a plugin version that adds
   * an endpoint has it closed by default instead of newly exposed. In-process
   * calls are unaffected: middleware sees HTTP, and `auth.api.*` from a server
   * component never becomes a request.

 * Re-stamp the session cookie's `Max-Age` on a page navigation.
 *
 * Better Auth slides a live session two ways at once: it pushes `expiresAt`
 * out in the database, and it re-sets the cookie with a fresh `Max-Age`. Only
 * the first of those survives a React Server Component render, because Next
 * forbids writing a cookie during one. So browsing pages keeps the session row
 * alive while the browser's copy of the cookie counts down from whenever a
 * route handler last wrote it.
 *
 * At the thirty-day window this app used to run, nobody would ever have hit
 * that. At twenty minutes it signs people out in the middle of working — row
 * alive, cookie gone. Measured rather than assumed: `GET /board` sends no
 * `Set-Cookie` at all, where `GET /api/stories` sends `Max-Age=1200`.
 *
 * Re-stamping is safe because the cookie is not the authority. It carries a
 * token whose validity is the `session` row, and `getSession` refuses an
 * expired row, so keeping the browser's copy for longer cannot extend a
 * session by one second. What it buys is the invariant worth having: the
 * cookie never dies before the row it names, and the two now slide on exactly
 * the same requests.
 *
 * `/api/*` is deliberately excluded. Those responses can and do set the cookie
 * themselves — and re-stamping there would resurrect the one that
 * `/api/auth/sign-out` had just deleted.
