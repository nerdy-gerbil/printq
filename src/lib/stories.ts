/**
 * Everything that can happen to a ticket, in one place.
 *
 * This file exists because there are now two front doors onto the same
 * operations — the server-rendered forms in `src/app/actions/stories.ts` and
 * the JSON API under `src/app/api/stories` — and an authorisation rule that
 * lives in the caller is a rule that only holds for the caller that
 * remembered it. Everything below takes an `Actor` and decides for itself:
 * who may, from which state, what the uploader is told, and what goes in the
 * trail. A new front door gets all of that by construction.
 *
 * The four rules the admin actions have always had are unchanged, and are
 * enforced here rather than in the layer above:
 *
 *   1. Role is checked on every call. Not rendering a button is not
 *      authorisation, and neither is not documenting an endpoint.
 *   2. Transitions go through `assertTransition` — forwards, one step, and
 *      `Declined` only from `Requested`.
 *   3. The uploader is told. That is the whole point of the Activity panel.
 *   4. An audit row is written *after* the change commits, so the trail
 *      cannot claim something that did not happen.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: `redirect`, `notFound`, and anything that
 * knows about a form or a status code. Failures leave as `StoryProblem`,
 * which carries an HTTP status the API can answer with and a sentence the
 * form can put in a toast. Translating one into the other is the caller's
 * job, because the right answer differs — see `src/lib/api.ts` for why the
 * API says 403 where a page says 404.

 * Say something on a ticket.
 *
 * Both sides may write here — it is the one place in the app where the client
 * has something to do besides upload and wait. Which is exactly why the
 * visibility check matters: the story is loaded through `storyScope`, so a
 * client naming another person's story id finds nothing and is told the
 * ticket does not exist. Not "you may not", which would confirm it does.
 *
 * The notification goes to the *other* side. Nobody needs telling about
 * their own comment, and a feed full of your own words is a feed people
 * stop reading.
