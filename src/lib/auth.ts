     *     because they are the same row in `session`. Suspension is caught by
     *     `currentUser()` either way.
     *   - **It is not `SameSite`-protected**, which is the one property the
     *     cookie has that this does not. It does not need to be: a page on
     *     another origin cannot attach an `Authorization` header to a
     *     cross-site request without a CORS preflight, and this app serves no
     *     CORS headers, so the preflight fails. Writes are Origin-checked as
     *     well — see `src/lib/api.ts`.
     *   - **It ends up in shell history and in logs** in a way a cookie does
     *     not. `docs/api.md` says so, and says to use a fresh sign-in for a
     *     script rather than the token from the browser you are sitting in.
     *
     * `requireSignature` is left at its default. Better Auth verifies the
     * token's HMAC either way — the option only decides whether an unsigned
     * token may be re-signed on the way in, and the token this app hands out
     * in `set-auth-token` is already the signed one.
