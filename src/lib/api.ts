/**
 * The JSON API's boundary.
 *
 * Route handlers under `/api` are not pages, and three things have to work
 * differently for them. All three live here rather than being remembered
 * fourteen times.
 *
 * **1. Refusals are answers, not redirects.** Middleware deliberately never
 * redirects `/api/*` — a caller with no session needs a 401 with a body it
 * can parse, not a 307 to an HTML sign-in page. That means every handler owes
 * its own authorisation check, and `withActor` is how it pays.
 *
 * **2. The API says 403 where a page says 404.** Everywhere else in this app
 * a team-only surface answers 404, because a 403 would confirm the route
 * exists. That reasoning does not survive publishing an OpenAPI document:
 * `/api/stories/{id}/advance` is listed at `/api/openapi.json` and rendered at
 * `/docs`, so its existence is already public and a 404 would be theatre —
 * worse than theatre, because it would tell an honest client that their
 * ticket had vanished when the truth is that they are not on the team.
 * Existence of a *ticket* is still hidden: an unauthorised read is 404, via
 * `storyScope`, exactly as before.
 *
 * **3. CSRF.** The app's model is Better Auth's — `SameSite=Lax` on the
 * session cookie, plus an Origin check — and this keeps to it. Any request
 * that changes something is refused if it arrives with an `Origin` header
 * naming somewhere other than this deployment. A browser always sends that
 * header on a cross-site write, so a hostile page cannot drive the API even
 * if the cookie somehow rode along; a script that is not a browser sends no
 * Origin at all and is allowed through, which is what makes `curl` and the
 * bearer token useful.

/**

 *
 * The one thing worth saying about this function is what it does not do:
 * there is no spread of the database row anywhere in it. Every field is named,
 * so a column added to the schema tomorrow — a private note, a cost, a
 * supplier reference — does not appear on the wire because somebody forgot to
 * exclude it. `storageKey` is the standing example: it is the object's name in
 * the bucket and it has never been anybody's business but the server's.
 *
 * `file.url` is the download route, not a signed storage URL. The bytes are
 * proxied through the app on purpose — see `src/app/api/models/[id]/route.ts`.
