/**
 * The credential the "Open in PrusaSlicer" link carries.
 *
 * The helper on somebody's own machine has to fetch model bytes from the app,
 * and it is not a browser: it holds no cookie. It used to hold a **bearer
 * token pasted into `~/.config/printq/slicer.conf`** — which was the session
 * token, and therefore a thirty-day, full-authority credential sitting in a
 * file. Shortening sessions to twenty idle minutes broke that outright (the
 * helper started answering `HTTP 401`), and the fix is not a longer-lived
 * credential in the same place. It is not needing one.
 *
 * So the link carries its own authority instead. `printq://slice/<id>?t=…` is
 * minted when the ticket is rendered, for the person looking at it and for
 * that model alone, and it expires in half an hour. Nothing secret is written
 * to disk at all: the config keeps only the address of the instance.
 *
 * **What this token is, precisely.** It asserts an *identity* and a *subject*,
 * and nothing else. It is not an authorisation: the route still loads the user,
 * refuses a suspended one, and re-applies `storyScope` against the database, so
 * a token cannot outlive the access it was minted under except within its own
 * half hour. Compared with what it replaces — the whole account, for thirty
 * days, revocable only by signing out — the exchange is a good one in every
 * direction.
 *
 * **Stateless on purpose.** An HMAC over the claim rather than a stored row:
 * the alternative writes a `verification` row on every render of every ticket,
 * to be read at most once and otherwise left to accumulate. The cost of that
 * choice is honest and worth stating: an outstanding link is **not** revoked by
 * signing out, because nothing is consulted to revoke. It IS revoked by
 * suspending the account, and by the scope check, and by half an hour passing.
 * For read access to one model the holder could already open, that is the right
 * side of the trade; it would not be for anything that writes.
