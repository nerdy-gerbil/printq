/**
 * The API console.
 *
 * A route handler rather than a page, deliberately. Swagger UI ships a large
 * stylesheet that expects to own the document, and the app's root layout owns
 * this one — four self-hosted webfonts, a diner palette and a paper texture.
 * Rendering one inside the other means two design systems arguing in every
 * cell of every table. Serving a plain document sidesteps that, and it is also
 * honest: this page is a tool for reading the API, not part of the product's
 * surface.
 *
 * It is behind a session for the same reason `/api/openapi.json` is: it
 * describes an invite-only app to the people already inside it. Middleware
 * only checks that a session cookie is *present*, so the real check is here —
 * a forged cookie gets a redirect to sign-in, not a console.
 *
 * Everything it loads comes from this origin: `scripts/vendor-swagger.ts`
 * copies Swagger UI into `public/docs/` at build time, so the page needs no
 * CSP relaxation and works on a deployment with no outbound internet.
 *
 * Two consequences of keeping the CSP intact, both of which are easy to get
 * wrong because getting them wrong still renders a page:
 *
 *   - The one inline script carries the request's nonce. Without it,
 *     production serves a document that loads Swagger UI and then never calls
 *     it — a blank frame under a header, with nothing in the log.
 *   - The console's own styling is a **file**, `public/api-console.css`, not
 *     an inline `<style>` block. `style-src` is `'self'` with no nonce for
 *     styles, so a block is dropped and the header simply arrives unstyled.

/**
 * Two settings worth explaining.
 *
 * `withCredentials` makes Swagger UI request with `credentials: "include"`
 * rather than its default `"same-origin"`. On this deployment the two are the
 * same thing — the console and the API share an origin — so it is stating the
 * intent rather than fixing anything. Note it is not a way to drive the API
 * from somewhere else: the app serves no CORS headers, so a cross-origin call
 * fails at the preflight regardless.
 *
 * `syntaxHighlight: false` is the difference between a console and a stall.
 * The document runs to 71 operations once Better Auth's half is folded in, and
 * highlighting every example is far and away the most expensive thing Swagger
 * UI does: rendering the lot took **147 ms with it off and about 55 seconds
 * with it on**, measured in Chrome against this build. Examples render as
 * plain monospace instead, which for a page people read to find a path is not
 * a loss worth four hundred times the wait.
