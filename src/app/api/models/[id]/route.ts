/**
 * The bytes of one model, for the viewer.
 *
 * Streamed through the app rather than handed out as a signed URL straight to
 * object storage. That is not the more elegant option, it is the only correct
 * one for this deployment: docker-compose.prod.yml publishes no port for
 * MinIO, so a browser cannot reach it at all — a signed URL would resolve to
 * nothing. Proxying also keeps `connect-src 'self'` intact, which means the
 * viewer needs no CSP relaxation.
 *
 * The trade is real: every viewer load moves the whole file through Next. At
 * 50 MB and a handful of people that is fine. If this ever faces a wider
 * audience, expose storage behind the same reverse proxy, hand out
 * `signedModelUrl`, and widen `connect-src` to that origin.
 *
 * Scoped with `storyScope`, the same fragment the story page composes, so a
 * client asking for someone else's model gets 404 — not 403, which would
 * confirm it exists.
 *
 * Two ways to be somebody here. The ordinary one is a session, cookie or
 * bearer. The other is `?t=`, the link credential minted into an
 * "Open in PrusaSlicer" link — see `src/lib/slicer-token.ts` for why a desktop
 * helper needs one and why it is not simply a long-lived token in a file.
 *
 * The token only ever answers *who*. Everything that decides *whether* runs
 * afterwards and identically for both doors: the account is loaded and refused
 * if suspended, and `storyScope` is re-applied against the database. A link
 * therefore cannot reach a model its holder has lost access to, and cannot
 * reach a different model than the one it names.
