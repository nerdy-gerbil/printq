 * over office wifi is long enough that a spinner is not good enough.
 *

 * been inspected, and no story row exists until the object is in place — so
 * a rejected file leaves nothing behind, and a story never points at an
 * object that was not stored.

 * Only so many uploads are handled at once.

 * This is what makes a 250 MB cap safe rather than hopeful. `request.formData()`
 * buffers the whole body before a line of this handler runs, so peak memory is
 * decided by how many large uploads overlap — nothing the validator does can
 * change that. Bounding the overlap bounds the memory, which is the "size-based
 * queue" the security audit named as one of the two answers. (The other,
 * a streaming parse, needs the file to stop arriving as multipart at all; see
 * docs/architecture.md.)
 *
 * A late arrival waits rather than being refused: somebody who has just spent a
 * minute pushing 200 MB up office wifi should not be told to start again. Only
 * once the queue itself is long does the app say no, because at that point the
 * honest answer is that it is busy.
 *
 * Per process. A second app instance has its own gate, which is the right
 * shape anyway — the memory it is protecting is also per process.
