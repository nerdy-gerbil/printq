 * typewriter for anything that behaves like a docket.

 * Loaded from ./fonts rather than `next/font/google`, which downloads them at
 * build time and so made every image build depend on fonts.googleapis.com
 * answering — CI's verify gate, the release build, and the README's own
 * build-from-source quick start. It failed that way once, and the error arrives
 * as a webpack stack trace about a font loader, which is nowhere near where
 * anyone looks. See ./fonts/README.md for the files and their licence.
