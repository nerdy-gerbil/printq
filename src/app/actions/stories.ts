 * The print team's panel, as plain forms.
 *
 * What each of these *does* lives in `src/lib/stories.ts`, which the JSON API
 * calls too — the rules about who may move a ticket, from which state, who
 * gets told and what goes in the trail are enforced there so both front doors
 * cannot drift apart. This file is the adapter: read a `FormData`, call the
 * operation, turn the outcome into a redirect.
 *
 * `requireManager()` still runs first, and is not redundant with the role
 * check inside the service. It is the one that answers 404 rather than 403,
 * which is what a page owes a user poking at a control that was never drawn
 * for them — the API answers differently, and deliberately. See
 * `src/lib/api.ts`.

 * to — the outcome travels in the query string and the page renders it as a
 * toast. That also means the whole panel works with JavaScript off.
 *
 * `from` arrives in the form body, so it is validated like any other
 * redirect target: same-origin absolute paths only. An open redirect is how
 * a phishing page borrows your domain's credibility.
