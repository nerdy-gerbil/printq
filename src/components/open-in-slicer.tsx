/**
 * "Open in PrusaSlicer" — a link to the `printq://` scheme a helper on the
 * viewer's own machine handles.
 *
 * Why a bare `<a>` to a custom scheme rather than a download, a signed URL, or
 * PrusaSlicer's own `prusaslicer://open?file=` deep link:
 *
 *   - `prusaslicer://` only downloads from a hardcoded allowlist
 *     (printables.com, thingiverse.com, cults3d.com) and there is no setting
 *     to add to it — a self-hosted instance can never be on that list. See
 *     docs/prusaslicer.md.
 *   - So the file is fetched by a small helper the printer owner installs
 *     once (`scripts/prusa-open.sh`), which hands PrusaSlicer a *local* path.
 *     A local file has no domain to check, so the allowlist never applies —
 *     that is the design, not a loophole.
 *
 * This link therefore adds nothing to the server and needs no client bundle:
 * clicking it invokes the OS protocol handler, which is not a fetch, so the
 * CSP does not govern it and there is no JavaScript here. On a machine with no
 * helper installed the click simply does nothing — the copy says as much, and
 * links to the one-time setup.
 *
 * The link carries the ticket id **and a short-lived credential minted for the
 * person reading this page**. It used to carry only the id, with a bearer token
 * pasted once into the helper's config — but that token was the session token,
 * so shortening sessions to twenty idle minutes stopped it working and the
 * helper started answering `HTTP 401`. Putting the credential in the link
 * rather than on disk fixes that and retires a thirty-day, full-authority
 * secret in a file at the same time. See `src/lib/slicer-token.ts`.
 *
 * Minted per render, so it is as fresh as the page. It is good for half an
 * hour, for this model only, and it authorises nothing on its own — the route
 * re-checks the account and re-applies `storyScope`.
 *
 * `DownloadModel` sits beside this rather than inside it: the same bytes with
 * no helper at all, for the printer owner who is not at the machine with the
 * slicer on it. Putting it behind this disclosure would have hidden the plain
 * answer behind the clever one.
