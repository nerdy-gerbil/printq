#
# printq → PrusaSlicer bridge. Handles a `printq://slice/<id>` link by fetching the
# model from a PrintQ - Requests instance and opening it in a local slicer.
#
# Runs ON THE PERSON'S OWN MACHINE — the one with the printer, PrusaSlicer, and
# a browser — not on the server. It is the whole reason "Open in PrusaSlicer"
# can exist at all: PrusaSlicer's own `prusaslicer://open?file=` refuses any
# URL that is not printables.com/thingiverse.com/cults3d.com, and there is no
# setting to add a self-hosted host to that list. So instead of asking the
# slicer to download, this downloads the bytes itself and hands the slicer a
# *local file*, which has no domain to check. See docs/prusaslicer.md.
#
# Installed as the handler for the `printq://` scheme by install-slicer-handler.sh.
# Invoked by the desktop environment with one argument: the clicked URL.
#
# Config lives at $PRINTQ_SLICER_CONF (default ~/.config/printq/slicer.conf) and sets:
#   PRINTQ_BASE          the instance, e.g. https://print.example         (required)
#   PRINTQ_SLICER        the slicer binary            (default: prusa-slicer)
#   PRINTQ_DOWNLOAD_DIR  where fetched models land    (default: ~/.cache/printq/models)
#   PRINTQ_TOKEN         DEPRECATED — see below                          (optional)
#
# THE CONFIG NO LONGER HOLDS A CREDENTIAL. The clicked link carries its own:
# `printq://slice/<id>?t=<token>`, minted by the app for the person who was looking
# at that ticket, good for half an hour and for that one model. Nothing secret
# is written to disk, so there is nothing here to leak or to rotate.
#
# It used to be PRINTQ_TOKEN, a bearer token pasted in once — which was the session
# token, so when sessions came down from thirty days to twenty idle minutes it
# stopped working and every click answered HTTP 401. PRINTQ_TOKEN is still honoured
# when a link carries no `t` (an old bookmark, say), but it is on the way out:
# delete it from the config and click the button again.
#
# Failures are made loud rather than swallowed: a protocol handler has no
# terminal, so every error goes to a log AND a desktop notification (when
# notify-send exists), because a click that silently does nothing is the worst
# possible outcome — indistinguishable from "not installed".
