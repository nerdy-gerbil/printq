/**
 * Copy every stored model out of MinIO and onto the filesystem, then prove it.
 *
 *   npm run migrate:storage          export, then verify
 *   npm run migrate:storage -- --verify-only    check an earlier run
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a script and not a documented `mc` command
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * MinIO does not store objects as files. Each one is a *directory* named after
 * the key, and for anything under its inline threshold the bytes live inside
 * `xl.meta` rather than beside it. On the dataset this was written against,
 * 160 of 179 objects were inlined — 89%.
 *
 * So the intuitive migration, `cp -r` the models directory and point the new
 * code at it, recovers about a tenth of the models and loses the rest. And it
 * loses them *quietly*: the directory tree is there, the filenames are there,
 * every ticket page still renders, and the only symptom is that opening a model
 * fails. Partial, silent, and entirely plausible-looking.
 *
 * The bytes can only come out through the S3 API, which is what this does.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What makes it safe
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   * It writes to a NEW directory and never touches MinIO's. Nothing it does
 *     is destructive; rolling back is deleting what it wrote.
 *   * It verifies against the DATABASE, not against MinIO. Asking MinIO whether
 *     it exported everything is asking the wrong witness — it would have
 *     happily confirmed 179 objects while 160 arrived empty. Every `Story` row
 *     must end up with a readable file of the right size.
 *   * It checks the bytes are a model, not just the right length. A file of
 *     zeroes passes a size comparison.
 *   * It is idempotent. A second run skips what is already correct, so it can
 *     be re-run after a partial failure, or again later to pick up uploads that
 *     happened in between.
 *   * It refuses to exit 0 if a single row is unaccounted for.
 *
 * DESTRUCTIVE: nothing. It only ever creates files under MODELS_ROOT.
