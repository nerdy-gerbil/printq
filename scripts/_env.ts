/**
 * Loads `.env` into the process environment, explicitly.
 *
 * The suites used to rely on Prisma loading `.env` on its own. That happens
 * to work on a developer machine and did not on a CI runner, where the whole
 * job failed with "Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL" several
 * steps after the file had been written. Relying on a library's incidental
 * behaviour for something this load-bearing is not worth the ten lines it
 * takes to do properly.
 *
 * Import this FIRST in any script, before anything that reaches for a
 * connection string:
 *
 *   import "./_env";
 *   import { db } from "../src/lib/db";
 *
 * ESM evaluates modules in import order, so that guarantees the variables are
 * set before Prisma is constructed.
 *
 * Real environment variables always win — CI can export values directly and
 * a stale `.env` will not silently override them.
