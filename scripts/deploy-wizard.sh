# printq deploy wizard — the single entry point for deploying PrintQ - Requests.
#
# Runs ON THE NAS, in the directory holding docker-compose.prod.yml and
# .env.docker. That placement is the whole design: the NAS has no source tree,
# no git and no toolchain — it consumes images CI built, signed and scanned —
# so the wizard asks the registry what exists rather than asking a checkout.
#
# It answers the questions a bare `sed PRINTQ_TAG && docker compose up -d` does
# not:
#   1. WHICH image?   → lists what is actually published to ghcr.io, newest
#      first, with publish dates and the live one marked, showing a release
#      version where one exists and the commit SHA otherwise. You pick from a
#      menu instead of copying a tag out of a CI log.
#   2. IS IT INTACT?  → cosign-verifies the image against the identity of the
#      release-images workflow on this repo before anything is swapped. If
#      cosign is absent it says so loudly rather than quietly skipping.
#   3. DID IT WORK?   → polls the public health URL after the swap, and rolls
#      back to the previous tag automatically if it does not come good.
#
# The images are public, so no registry credential is needed to pull one. A
# token is optional and buys only a longer menu: GitHub gates the package
# *listing* API even for public packages, so without one the wizard lists
# releases instead — which is the right list for most deployments anyway.
#
# When a token IS given (a fork with private packages, or someone following
# main by SHA) it is borrowed and returned: read from a hidden prompt, used for
# the pull, then `docker logout` on exit including on failure. Nothing
# long-lived is left behind.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy-wizard.sh              # interactive
#   ./deploy-wizard.sh -n 25        # widen the candidate window
#   ./deploy-wizard.sh --status     # read-only: what is live, and what is new
#
# Nothing is pulled or swapped without an explicit menu choice and a y/N.
